# **Data Analysis For Coffee Shop Sales Data**

## Intro
In this project, we take a deep dive into the sales data of a coffee shop for a 6 month period.

The dataset contains 1208 unique transactions spanning from 2024/03/01 to 2024/08/08 with the below attributes:
  * Transaction date
  * Transaction date & time
  * Transaction type (Cash or Card)
  * Card number
  * Sales amount
  * Product name

We'll use _Python_, _Microsoft SQL Server_ and _Microsoft PowerBI_ to ingest, process, visualize and analyze the dataset to answer key business questions relevant to the sales performance, product performance and customer behaviour of the coffee shop.

## Goals
  * To create an end-to-end solution for ingesting, storing and surfacing the data.
  * To expand the dataset by inferring additional dimensions to further slice the data.
  * To Provide metrics to articulate the performance of the coffee shop in an easy to understand format.
  * To answer key business questions (Phrased from the Coffee Shop's perspective):
      * What is our total revenue? How many customers did we serve? How many beverages did we sell?
      * What is the sales trend for the period? And, given the trend, what will the next few days look like? And next month?
      * What is our busiest day? And time of day?
      * What is our performance compared to the previous month? Are we growing?
      * Which products are our best and worst sellers?
      * What days do we sell the most? And time of day?
